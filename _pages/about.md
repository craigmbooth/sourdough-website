I'm a scientist by training -- with a PhD in theoretical astrophysics -- and I spent over a decade working in the field of astrophysics.  I'm also a home baker, and I've been baking sourdough bread for the last 5 years.

When I learn a new craft, I like to dive deep into the science behind it.  I've found that this helps me to understand that craft better, and also that improving my understanding of something both deepens my appreciation for it and makes it more enjoyable.  I hope that I can share a little of that with the world.

Should you be curious who is behind this, I'm at [craigmbooth.com](https://craigmbooth.com), and here is a picture of me [touching grass](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/touch-grass):
