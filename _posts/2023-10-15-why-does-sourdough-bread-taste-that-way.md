Fermentation in the sourdough process is one of the critical processes that causes sourdough to be better tasting and healthier than yeasted bread.  In \chapref{chap:yeast} we were also introduced to the sourdough starter in isolation.  The starter is a stable culture of yeast and lactic acid bacteria that live together, and through the action of eating the sugars in flour, produce many of the health and taste benefits of sourdough.  In this chapter we'll be diving into a bake from the point-of-view of the fermentation process.  We will be looking in more detail at the make-up of a starter, and the roles played by each of its constituents, and we'll be asking how and why this leads to delicious sourdough bread.

Figuring out what causes bread to have its flavor is an active area of research, and if you read any papers on the subject you'll be barraged with the names of chemicals.  Over 540 molecules that give sourdough its flavor have been discovered\cite{ptel17}.  To pull a handful at random from a hat\cite{hansen96}: 2-methyl-propanal, 3-methyl-butanal, isopentanal, 2-nonenal, benzylethanol, 2-phenylethanol, dimethyl sulphide and 2-furfural.

As a simple demonstration that sourdough fermentation impacts the taste of bread, Fig.~\ref{fig:flavor_vs_sourdough} shows results\cite{hansen96} where a panel of tasters placed the acidity of bread on a 1-10 scale.  There is a clear positive correlation between the acidity of the bread and the percentage of sourdough used in the bake.  Now, acidity alone isn't a pleasant taste, this experiment alone demonstrates that sourdough fermentation impacts flavor, but not how.

Other studies have focused on how sourdough *improves* the taste of bread and, indeed, use of sourdough can improve the flavor of bread\cite{hansen96}. The flavor of sourdough wheat bread is richer and more aromatic than wheat bread, and tasters in one study\cite{hansen96} preferred breads baked with 5-10\% sourdough by weight.  Table~\ref{tab:taste_adjectives}.

| Yeasted Bread | Sourdough Bread |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Flour         | Mild Sour       |
| Sweet         | Fresh           |
| Yeasty        | Aromatic        |

## How is flavor generated

As we saw in Chap.\ref{chap:yeast}, a sourdough starter contains 1-3 species of yeast, and a few more (1-5 or so) species of lactic acid bacteria.  When dough is mixed, water is able to hydrate the flour (Chap.~\ref{chap:water}), and the following sequence of things happen
### Water Helps Enzymes Get to Flour

Yeast eats sugar.  Flour contains only 1\%-1\% sugar by weight.  Nowhere near enough to grow all that yeast, so what happens?

Water and enzymes is what happens.  As we saw in Sec.~\ref{sec:what_is_flour}, flour contains an enzyme named amylase \index{Amylase}. When the flour is mixed with water, the amylase becomes active.  Amylase begins to break down the starches in the flour (see Chap.\ref{chap:flour}), into sugars that are the perfect food source for yeast and bacteria.

So at this point, the yeast and bacteria are in contact with a food source, and they start doing their thing:  eating and pooping.

### Eating and pooping: The Action of Yeasts

We'll start by talking about yeast, since this is what people are usually associate with bread baking.  Yeast can do two things:  respiration and fermentation.  When the yeast has the choice, it will respire (Fig.~\ref{fig:respiration_fermentation}, upper picture).  In respiration, the yeast takes food (glucose), and oxygen molecules (O$_2$).  It turns these into carbon dioxide (\cotwo) and water (\htwoo).  In this way the yeast can effectively use up almost all the oxygen inside the dough.

![Figure showing the chemical formulae for yeast respiration and fermentation]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/taste/respiration_fermentation.png)

When conditions become less suitable for respiration (which happens if the yeast is in a low-oxygen environment or has enough glucose\cite{verduyn84}), yeast switches to doing fermentation (Fig.~\ref{fig:respiration_fermentation}, lower panel).  Here it turns glucose into ethanol and \cotwo. Yeast can transform 95\% of fermentable foods in flour into ethanol, ethanol is either converted into flavor compounds during fermentation, or boils off during cooking since the boiling point of ethanol is \degCF{78}, while the typical temperature of the center of a loaf of bread after baking is \degCF{88} \cite{martinez96}.  Ethanol will also be converted into flavorful compounds during the fermentation process (Sec.~\ref{sec:booze_to_flavor})

The \cotwo is what inflates bubbles in the dough (see Sec.~\ref{sec:getting_bubbly} for a description of how \cotwo moves around in dough and blows bubbles).  If you want to clearly demonstrate to yourself that yeast creates carbon dioxide, you can perform a simple experiment, simply feed your starter, take a sample of that and put it in an airtight Ziploc bag.  After a few hours (don't forget the lag phase; Sec.~\ref{sec:yeast_lag_phase}) you'll see that the bag is noticeably puffy, and a few hours after that it should have undergone a significant amount of inflation.

Yeast fermentation is common to all bread types.  There are c

### Turning Booze into Flavor

Is a fact that was widely appreciated since at least the 1920's.

Sandwiched in the Canadian Medical Association Journal from November 1926, between a report about tuberculosis vaccine tests in monkeys and a story stating that "A proton, the heart of an atom, would look like a porcelain doorknob if we could see its sphere of influence" is the following\cite{canmed26}

<blockquote>
  Professor Nicholas Knight and Miss Violet Simpson, chemists at Cornell College, Iowa, reported to the American Chemical Society that they had collected twelve samples of ordinary bread from bakeries and housewives' ovens and after chemical analyses found that the alcohol content of this prosaic food varied from .04 to 1.9 per cent, the latter quantity being well above the one half of one per cent limit set by the well-known prohibition statute.
</blockquote>

There are two categories of flavour compounds, produced during sourdough fermentation. Non-volatile compounds including organic acids produced by homo- (Gobbetti,
Corsetti, \& De Vincenzi, 1995a) and heterofermentative bacteria (Gobbetti, Corsetti, \& De Vincenzi, 1995b) which acidify, decrease pH and contribute aroma to the bread dough (Barber, Benedito de Barber, Martinez-Anaya, Martinez, \& Alberola,
1985; Galal, Johnson, \& Varriano-Marston, 1978). The second category e volatile compounds of sourdough bread e includes alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters
and sulphur. All these compounds are produced by biological and biochemical actions during fermentation and contribute to flavour (Spicher, 1983).

A fermentation temperature of \degCF{5} is however also
used in dough retarding (Cauvain, 1998) and this low temperature
has been shown to increase formation of esters (characterised as
having a fruity and pleasant odour) during dough fermentation
(Birch et al., 2013b).
## A Love Triangle: Temperature and Fermentation and Flavor

The fermentation temperature influences the fermentation quotient, which is the ratio of lactic acid to acetic acid, by which higher temperatures cause a shift toward higher lactic acid production, thus enhancing acidification of the sourdoughs (Brandt et al., 2004; Corsetti, 2013; Martinez-Anaya, Llin, Pilar Macias, \& Collar, 1994)

Low fermentation temperatures slow down LAB acidification and, in the presence of LAB, favor yeast growth, ethanol production, carbon dioxide production (and thus leavening), and flavor formation 122 Luc De Vuyst et al. (Hâ‚¬aggman \& Salovaara, 2008a, 2008b; Simonson, Salovaara, \& Korhola, 2003).
