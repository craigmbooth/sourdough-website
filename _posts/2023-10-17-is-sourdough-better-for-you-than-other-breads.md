Fermentated foods, sourdough included, have undergone an explosion in popularity in recent years.  This was driven in part by their proposed health benefits (see e.g. \cite{dimidi19} for a review).  Now, sourdough is not considered a probiotic, the temperatures reached by the center of a loaf (\degCF{88}) during cooking are high enough to kill all microorganisms.  contrast this to something like yogurt that is never heated and therefore is full of living bacteria.  The beneficial effects of eating sourdough are due to the effects of the prior hours of fermentation by those microbes.  Here we summarize a few of the health benefits of sourdough bread relative a more standard yeasted bread.

\subsubsection{It has a lower glycemic index} \index{Glycemic index}

\index{Diabetes} The Glycemic index (GI) of food is a ranking based on  their immediate effect on  blood glucose levels.  Foods with lots of easily digestible carbohydrates have a high GI, and after they're eaten, they spike levels of blood sugar significantly.  Foods with a lower GI release their energy more slowly.  Although GI is only one component of the overall healthfulness, some research has linked high GI diets with a greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes\cite{bhupathiraju14}, higher cholesterol levels\cite{fleming13}, and more heart disease\cite{derougemont07}.  Foods can be broadly classified into three categories (low GI $\le$55, medium GI 55â€“69 or high GI $\ge$70).  For reference, a whole meal bread without sourdough fermentation has a GI of around 70.

Although bread, by its nature will remain relatively high GI, it has been found that sourdough fermentation is able to reduce the digestibility of some starches\cite{ostman02}, and correspondingly reduces blood sugar and insulin responses when compared to yeasted bread\cite{liljeberg95} and reduce its glycemic index\cite{stamataki17}, with some studies indicating that depending on the precise formulation, the bread may end up with a GI around 40-60\cite{novotni10, novotni12}.  This is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:gi}, which shows the measurement of the GI of some bread from \cite{devuyts09}\index{Glycemic index!measurement}.  The two curves on this chart show the mean increase in blood sugar in 20 healthy volunteers after ingesting glucose, and after ingesting sourdough.  The blood sugar increment is around 40.1\% of that of pure glucose (which has a GI of 100), so the GI of the sourdough is 41.1, a figure low enough to indicate that this type of bread could have significant health impacts.

The two lines in this chart show the increase in blood sugar over time after ingesting glucose (yellow-brown line) and sourdough bread (blue line).  The blood sugar spike for sourdough is approximately 41\% the size of that for glucose, indicating that the sourdough has a GI of 41.  This is a significantly lower GI than for a standard wheat bread.  Adapted from \cite{devuyts09}}

\subsubsection {It Increases Available Bioactive Compounds} \index{Folates}

Fermenting with sourdough improves the bioavailability \cite{katina05}, in particular, the addition of a sourdough fermentation phase more than doubled the availability of folates and phenolic compounds, and B-complex vitamins\cite{batifoulier05} relative to yeasted bread.  Folate intake is necessary for several processes in the body, and associations between low folate level and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cognitive dysfunction have been reported\cite{ebara17}. Many studies have shown a strong and positive correlation between the presence of phenolic compound and the antioxidant effects of foods, \cite{minatel17},  which (among other things) to decrease inflammation in the body related with chronic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes) \cite{eliassen12,tanaka12}

\subsubsection {It Has More Bioavailable Minerals} \index{Phytic acid}

Phytic acid is a substance found in many plant-based foods, including wheat flour where it is present in an amount of around 3 mg/g in refined flour, and 8.5 mg/g in whole wheat flour\cite{febles02}.  Phytate is commonly called an "anti-nutrient" because it tends to bind to common minerals, including iron, zinc, magnesium and calcium, meaning that they are unavailable for absorption into the body\cite{lopez98}.

A prolonged sourdough fermentation was found to decrease phytic acid levels by 62\%, relative to only 38\% for a more standard yeast-based fermentation process\cite{lopez01}. Thus, it should be expected that relative to other breads, sourdough is able to supply more of these vital minerals.
